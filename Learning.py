#Welcome to Python!
'''
Python is a high-level programming language, with applications in numerous areas, including web programming, scripting, scientific computing, and artificial intelligence.

It is very popular and used by organizations such as Google, NASA, the CIA, and Disney.
Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. There is no need to compile your program before executing it.

Q1. Python is a:

* It of editing tools
* Programming language  
* Development environment

#Welcome to Python!
'''
The three major versions of Python are 1.x, 2.x and 3.x. These are subdivided into minor versions, such as 2.7 and 3.3.
Code written for Python 3.x is guaranteed to work in all future versions.
Both Python Version 2.x and 3.x are used currently.
This course covers Python 3.x, but it isn't hard to change from one version to another.

Python has several different implementations, written in various languages.
The version used in this course, CPython, is the most popular by far.
An interpreter is a program that runs scripts written in an interpreted language such as Python.

Q2. Which of these statements is true?

*Python code must be always compiled
*Python 1.7 is the most widely used version
*CPython is an implementation of Python

#Your First Program
'''
Let's start off by creating a short program that displays "Hello world!".
In Python, we use the print statement to output text:
>>> print('Hello world!')
Hello world!
Try It Yourself

Congratulations! You have written your first program.
Run, save, and share your Python code on our Code Playground without installing any additional software.
When using a computer, you will need to download and install Python from www.python.org.
Note the >>> in the code above. They are the prompt symbol of the Python console. Python is an interpreted language, 
which means that each line is executed as it is entered. Python also includes IDLE, the integrated development environment, 
which includes tools for writing and debugging entire programs.

Q3. Fill in the blanks to print "Hi".

>>> _____("Hi")
Ans. print

Printing Text

The print statement can also be used to output multiple lines of text.
For Example:
>>> print('Hello world!')
Hello world!
>>> print('Hello world!')
Hello world!
>>> print('Spam and eggs...')
Spam and eggs...
Try It Yourself

Python code often contains references to the comedy group Monty Python. This is why the words, "spam" and "eggs" are often used 
as placeholder variables in Python where "foo" and "bar" would be used in other programming languages.
Q4. Fill in the blank to output "ni ni ni".

>>> _____('ni ni ni'_
