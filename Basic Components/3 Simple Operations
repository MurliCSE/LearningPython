#Simple Operations

'''
Python has the capability of carrying out calculations.
Enter a calculation directly into the Python console, and it will output the answer.
>>> 2 + 2
4
>>> 5 + 4 - 3
6

The spaces around the plus and minus signs here are optional (the code would work without them), but they make it easier to read.

'''
What does this code output?
>>> 1 + 2 + 3
6

Python also carries out multiplication and division, using an asterisk to indicate multiplication and a forward slash to indicate 
division.

Use parentheses to determine which operations are performed first.
>>> 2 * (3 + 4)
14
>>> 10 / 2
5.0

Using a single slash to divide numbers produces a decimal (or float, as it is called in programming). We'll have more about floats 
in a later lesson.

Which option is output by this code?
>>> (4 + 8) / 2

6.0
8
6

Simple Operations

The minus sign indicates a negative number.
Operations are performed on negative numbers, just as they are on positive ones.
>>> -7
-7
>>> (-7 + 2) * (-4)
20

The plus signs can also be put in front of numbers, but this has no effect, and is mostly used to emphasize that a number is positive 
to increase readability of code.

Fill in the blank to make this code correct.

>>> (_5 - 1) * 3
-18

Dividing by zero in Python produces an error, as no answer can be calculated.
>>> 11 / 0
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

In Python, the last line of an error message indicates the error's type.
Read error messages carefully, as they often tell you how to fix a program!

Drag and drop the answer that will cause a ZeroDivisionError.

>>> (17 + 94) / (-5 +_)
0 -5 5
