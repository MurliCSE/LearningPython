#Your First Program
'''
Let's start off by creating a short program that displays "Hello world!".
In Python, we use the print statement to output text:
>>> print('Hello world!')
Hello world!
Try It Yourself
Congratulations! You have written your first program.
Run, save, and share your Python code on our Code Playground without installing any additional software.
When using a computer, you will need to download and install Python from www.python.org.
Note the >>> in the code above. They are the prompt symbol of the Python console. Python is an interpreted language, 
which means that each line is executed as it is entered. Python also includes IDLE, the integrated development environment, 
which includes tools for writing and debugging entire programs.
Q3. Fill in the blanks to print "Hi".
>>> _____("Hi")
Ans. print
Printing Text
The print statement can also be used to output multiple lines of text.
For Example:
>>> print('Hello world!')
Hello world!
>>> print('Hello world!')
Hello world!
>>> print('Spam and eggs...')
Spam and eggs...
Try It Yourself
Python code often contains references to the comedy group Monty Python. This is why the words, "spam" and "eggs" are often used 
as placeholder variables in Python where "foo" and "bar" would be used in other programming languages.
Q4. Fill in the blank to output "ni ni ni".
>>> _____('ni ni ni'_
