#Type Conversion

Type Conversion

In Python, it's impossible to complete certain operations due to the types involved. For instance, you can't add two strings containing 
the numbers 2 and 3 together to produce the integer 5, as the operation will be performed on strings, making the result '23'.
The solution to this is type conversion.
In that example, you would use the int function.
>>> "2" + "3"
'23'
>>> int("2") + int("3")
5

In Python, the types we have used so far have been integers, floats, and strings. The functions used to convert to these are int, float 
and str, respectively.

Q. What is the output of this code?
>>> int("3" + "4")

"7"
34
"34"

Ans. 34

Another example of type conversion is turning user input (which is a string) to numbers (integers or floats), to allow for the 
performance of calculations.
>>> float(input("Enter a number: ")) + float(input("Enter another number: "))
Enter a number: 40
Enter another number: 2
42.0

Passing non-integer or float values will cause an error.

Q. What is the output of this code?
>>> float("210" * int(input("Enter a number:" )))
Enter a number: 2

210210.0
420
"210210"
"420.0"

Ans. 210210.0
