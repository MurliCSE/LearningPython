#Loops

'''
Sometimes, you need to perform code on each item in a list. This is called iteration, and it can be accomplished with a while loop and a counter variable.
For example:
words = ["hello", "world", "spam", "eggs"]
counter = 0
max_index = len(words) - 1

while counter <= max_index:
   word = words[counter]
   print(word + "!")
   counter = counter + 1 
Try It Yourself

Result:
>>>
hello!
world!
spam!
eggs!
>>>

The example above iterates through all items in the list, accesses them using their indices, and prints them with exclamation marks.
