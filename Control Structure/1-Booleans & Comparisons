#Booleans & Comparisons

'''
Another type in Python is the Boolean type. There are two Boolean values: True and False.
They can be created by comparing values, for instance by using the equal operator ==.
>>> my_boolean = True
>>> my_boolean
True

>>> 2 == 3
False
>>> "hello" == "hello"
True

Be careful not to confuse assignment (one equals sign) with comparison (two equals signs).

Q. What are the two Boolean values in Python?

Truth and Falsity
true and false
True and False
Ans. True and False

#Comparison

Another comparison operator, the not equal operator (!=), evaluates to True if the items being compared aren't equal, and False if they 
are.
>>> 1 != 1
False
>>> "eleven" != "seven"
True
>>> 2 != 10
True

Q. What is the output of this code?
>>> 7 != 8

True
False

Ans. True

Python also has operators that determine whether one number (float or integer) is greater than or smaller than another. These operators 
are > and < respectively.
>>> 7 > 5
True
>>> 10 < 10
False

Q. What is the output of this code?
>>> 7 > 7.0

False
True

The greater than or equal to, and smaller than or equal to operators are >= and <=.
They are the same as the strict greater than and smaller than operators, except that they return True when comparing equal numbers.
>>> 7 <= 8
True
>>> 9 >= 9.0
True

Greater than and smaller than operators can also be used to compare strings lexicographically (the alphabetical order of words is 
based on the alphabetical order of their component letters).

Q. What is the output of this code?
>>> 8.7 <= 8.70

False
An error occurs
True
