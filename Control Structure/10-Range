#Range

'''
The range function creates a sequential list of numbers.
The code below generates a list containing all of the integers, up to 10.
numbers = list(range(10))
print(numbers)
Try It Yourself

Result:
>>>
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
>>>

The call to list is necessary because range by itself creates a range object, and this must be converted to a list if you want to use it 
as one.

Q. What is the result of this code?
nums = list(range(5))
print(nums[4])

Ans. 4

If range is called with one argument, it produces an object with values from 0 to that argument.
If it is called with two arguments, it produces values from the first to the second.
For example:
numbers = list(range(3, 8))
print(numbers)

print(range(20) == range(0, 20))

Result:
>>>
[3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

True

Q. What is the result of this code?
nums = list(range(5, 8))
print(len(nums))
Ans. 3

Range

range can have a third argument, which determines the interval of the sequence produced. This third argument must be an integer.
numbers = list(range(5, 20, 2))
print(numbers)

Result:
>>>
[5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19]
>>>

Q. What is the result of this code?
nums = list(range(3, 15, 3))
print(nums[2])
