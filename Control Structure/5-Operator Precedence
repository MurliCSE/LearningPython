#Operator Precedence

'''
Operator precedence is a very important concept in programming. It is an extension of the mathematical idea of order of operations 
(multiplication being performed before addition, etc.) to include other operators, such as those in Boolean logic.

The below code shows that == has a higher precedence than or:
>>> False == False or True
True
>>> False == (False or True)
False
>>> (False == False) or True
True

Python's order of operations is the same as that of normal mathematics: parentheses first, then exponentiation, then 
multiplication/division, and then addition/subtraction.
